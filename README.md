# 2B1Q - Team Data Pulse

---  

2B1Q (2 binaries, 1 quaternary) line code algorithm for data transmission.  

2 bits (2B) are encoded into one of 4 possible voltage levels (quaternary, 1Q).  

When the 2B signal is used, ts voltage is flipped to positive or negative polarity.  

This project implements the 2B1Q algorithm, both receiver and sender with GUI and signal graph visualization.

Data is crypto-secured with a XOR cipher.
