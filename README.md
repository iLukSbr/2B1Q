# 2B1Q  

---  

Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) Basic Rate Interface (BRI) line code algorithm for data transmission.  

2 bits (2B) are encoded into one of 4 possible voltage levels (quaternary, 1Q).  

This project implements the 2B1Q algorithm, both receiver and sender with GUI and signal graph visualization.

Data is crypto-secured with a XOR cipher.
