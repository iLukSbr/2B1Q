# 2B1Q - Team Data Pulse

---  

Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) Basic Rate Interface (BRI) line code algorithm for data transmission.  

2 bits (2B) are encoded into one of 4 possible voltage levels (quaternary, 1Q).  

When the 2B signal is the same as the previous, its voltage is flipped to positive or negative due to error mitigation.  

This project implements the 2B1Q algorithm, both receiver and sender with GUI and signal graph visualization.

Data is crypto-secured with a XOR cipher.
